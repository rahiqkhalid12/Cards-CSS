                <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
                <p>
                    a British computer scientist working at CERN. In the late 1980s, he conceived 
                    the idea of the World Wide Web as a way to share information among researchers.
                    In 1990, he proposed the concept of the web and created the first web browser and web server software.
                    In 1991, Berners-Lee introduced HTML, 
                    the fundamental language of the web. HTML allowed the structuring of documents with hyperlinks, 
                    forming the basis of web pages.

                <p>
                    is prominent Norwegian web pioneer best known as the inventor of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
                    a fundamental technology for styling web pages. He introduced the concept of CSS in 1994.
                    CSS allows developers to separate content from design, enabling more flexible and efficient web design.

                <h3>Brendan Eich</h3>
                <p>
                    is a prominent American technologist and the creator of JavaScript, 
                    one of the most widely used programming languages in web development. 
                    He developed JavaScript in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications, 
                    aiming to enable dynamic web pages in browsers.
                    Eich co-founded the Mozilla project, which led to the development of the Firefox web browser.

                <h3>Ryan Dahl</h3>
                <p>
                    is a software engineer best known for creating Node.js,
                    a popular JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable network applications using server-side 
                    JavaScript. He introduced Node.js in 2009, revolutionizing web development by enabling non-blocking,
                    event-driven programming, which made it highly efficient for I/O-heavy tasks like handling multiple
                    requests concurrently.
